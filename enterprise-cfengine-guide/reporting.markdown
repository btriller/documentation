CFEngine Enterprise can report on promise outcomes (changes made by `cf-agent`
across your infrastructure), variables, classes, and measurements taken by
`cf-monitord`. Reports cover fine grained policy details, explore all the
options by checking out the [custom reports section][Reporting UI#query builder]
of the Enterprise Reporting module.

Specifically which information allowed to be collected by the hub for reporting
is configured by [`report_data_select` bodies][access#report_data_select].
`default_data_select_host()` defines the data to be collected for a non policy hub
and `default_data_select_policy_hub()` defines the data that should be collected
for a policy hub.

Specifying which variables and classes should be collected by an Enterprise Hub
is done with a list of regular expressions matching promise meta tags for either
[inclusion][access#metatags_include] or [exclusion][access#metatags_exclude]. By
default we collect `variables` and `classes` that are tagged with either
`report` or `inventory`. Instead of extending this list of tags we recommend
that you tag variables and classes with `report`. If it's desirable to make
available in specialized inventory reporting interface then you it should be
tagged with `inventory` and given an additional `attribute_name=` tag as
described in the [Custom Inventory Example][Custom Inventory]. By default
CFEngine collects information for all promise outcomes. This can be further
restricted by specifying [promise_handle_include][access#promise_handle_include]
or [promise_handle_exclude][access#promise_handle_exclude]. Collection of
measurements taken by `cf-monitord` are is controlled using the
`monitoring_include` and `monitoring_exclude` `report_data_select` body
attributes.

**Limitations:**

There are various limitations with regard to the size of information that is
collected into central reporting. Data that is too large to be reported will be
truncated and a verbose level log message will be generated by cf-agent. Some
noteable limitations are listed below.

* string variables are limited to 1024 bytes
* lists are limited to 1024 bytes of serialized data
* data variables are limited to 1024 bytes of serialized data
* meta tags limited to 1024 bytes of serailized output
* log messages are truncated to 400 bytes

Please note that these limits may be lower in practice due to internal
encoding.

Users can not configure the data is stored to disk. For example, you can not
prevent the enterprise agent from logging to `promise_log.jsonl`.

For information on accessing reported information please see the
[Reporting UI guide][Reporting UI].
